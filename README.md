# Smart Speed Warning System 🚗⚠️

## Description
This project is an Arduino-based smart safety system that detects the speed of a moving vehicle using an ultrasonic sensor.
If the speed exceeds a safe limit, a buzzer is activated to warn the driver.

Unlike traditional traffic lights, this system reacts dynamically based on vehicle speed.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Green LED
- Yellow LED
- Red LED
- Buzzer
- Resistors
- Push Button (optional)

## How It Works
1. The ultrasonic sensor measures distance continuously.
2. The system calculates the vehicle speed based on distance variation over time.
3. LEDs indicate the speed level.
4. A buzzer alerts the driver if the speed is dangerous.

## Applications
- School zones
- Hospitals
- Narrow streets
- Smart city projects
